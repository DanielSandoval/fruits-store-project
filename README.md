### Description
1. I developed an online store for fruits and vegetables using Node.js and MongoDB. Users can browse and purchase fresh products, and the data is securely stored in a MongoDB database. I implemented user authentication and authorization to enhance the user experience. I performed unit tests and endpoint testing to ensure robust functionality and reliability.
2. I created a real-time chat application using WebSockets and Node.js. Users can join chat rooms, send messages, and view real-time updates. This application showcases my skills in real-time web development.
